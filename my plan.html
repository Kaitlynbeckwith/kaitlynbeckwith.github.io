<p>I have many goals in life. Both personal and professional goals. My current hobbies have led me to have a goal of becoming Miss Maine USA, and be able to support myself modeling for a big agency in New York or LA. My current plan for after I get my degree up at Umaine is to go to fashion school and eventually work for a company in the fashion industry as a PR. </p>
