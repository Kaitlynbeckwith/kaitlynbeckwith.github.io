<p> The current classes I am taking are Business 235, Public Communication 103, English 101, Microeconomics and FSN 101. This semester my favorite class I am taking is Public Communication. In this class we prepare public speeches and learn how to get over the nerves of speaking in front of a group of people. I am very excited to see what my change in major brings me. I am ready for all of the other  public speaking classes I will be taking. Go to my next page to see  <A HREF= "my plan.html"> My Plan </A> </P>
