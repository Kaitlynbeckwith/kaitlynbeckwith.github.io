<p> I was born and raised in Lewiston, Maine. Lewiston is known for their sports. Both hockey and cheerleading. Throughout my childhood I played sports for my local recreation programs. I did cheerleading, basketball, track and softball. Although I played many sports. My love was for cheerleading. For fourteen years my team and I represented my hometown in both all star and for school. I traveled the country taking national titles back to Lewiston.

<p> I am blessed to have been able to grow up in such a beautiful state. One of the best things about Maine is having all four seasons. The fall season up in Maine is the best time of year.

<h1> Welcome to my Current Studies </h1>
